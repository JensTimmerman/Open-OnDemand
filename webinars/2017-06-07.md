Subject: Open OnDemand – Supporting your HPC needs now more than ever

When: Wednesday, June 7, 2017 from 12:30–2:00PM (Eastern)

Presenter: Basil Mohamed Gohar, OSC Web & Interface Applications Manager

Abstract: The Open OnDemand Project is an open-source software project, based on OSC's proven “OSC OnDemand” platform, that enables HPC centers to install and deploy advanced web and graphical interfaces for their users.  In addition to an overview of features, we will discuss new developments in Open OnDemand's support for additional resource managers such as Slurm and LSF as well as support for interactive desktop applications.  Early adopters of Open OnDemand will also present their experiences including installation, setup & configuration, and use cases.
